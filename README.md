T5 Model - React & FastAPI Application
This project is a Question-Answering Application powered by a fine-tuned T5 model trained on the Turkish language. The frontend is built with React.js, and the backend is developed using FastAPI.

🚀 Technologies Used
🔮 T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) – Fine-tuned for the Turkish language

⚡ FastAPI – A modern, high-performance web framework for serving the model

⚛️ React.js – For collecting user questions and displaying answers

🧠 HuggingFace Transformers – For loading the model and generating responses

🔗 Google Drive – Used to store the large model file externally

✍️ How to Use
Type a question into the input box on the page.

Click the "Submit" button.

Instantly view the response generated by the model.

🔀 Example Question
Input:
Product: Ravla Zeytinyağı Questions: Soğuk sıkım mı?

Model Response:
Yes, this product is cold-pressed olive oil.


📌 Notes
The model file is ignored via .gitignore because it exceeds 500 MB.

git-lfs could be used as an alternative, but Google Drive is preferred for simplicity.
